# Create a new repository from template

Go to the [template](https://github.com/indie-pipeline/indie-blueprint) and create a new repository from it

![use_template](images/use_template.png)

---

# Configuration

This template starts with some initial configurations that you need to know to get the most out of it.

## Default bus layout

There is a default bus layout to use in your project that are sufficient for any small-medium indie game, you can extend it or modify based on your use case but here's a good place to start

![bus_layout](images/bus_layout.png)

- `Master`: The master bus where all the other inherit froms
- `Music`: Mainly used to play looping music in your game
- `SFX/EchoSFX`: Sound effects like gun shots, hits, footsteps and so on. When you want to add an echo effect to the effect use the “EchoSFX” bus.
- `Voice`: Dialogues, ai voice effects, breath.
- `UI`: User interface sounds, button clicks, hover, transition animations, etc.
- `Ambient`: Ambient sounds like wind, nature, ocean, house interior and other stuff

## Input map

This project comes with very simple predefined input maps to avoid interfering with your game in a tedious way

- `WASD` movement with the keys `move_forward`, `move_back`, `move_right`, `move_left`
- `WASD` keys as been added to the existing ui input maps `ui_up`, `ui_down`, `ui_right`, `ui_left`
- The input action `debug_metrics` **_Shift+P_** opens the performance metrics when `hardware_information.tscn` it's on the scene tree

## Physics layers 2D & 3D

- `Layer 1`: It's named **World**
- `Layer 2`: It's named **Player**
- `Layer 3`: It's named **Enemies**
- `Layer 4`: It's named **Hitboxes**, `hitboxes` are collision areas that `hurtboxes` detects to implement a damage or impact system.

# Autoloads

A bunch of autoloads are ready to use for common operation in videogames to manage audio, global variables, signals, gamepad support, persistence, etc.

## GameGlobals & GlobalGameEvents

This singletons works to share data across nodes, they are always on the scene tree and can be accesed anywhere.

`GameGlobals` contains the pre-configured physic layer values and is intended to implement here the variables or functions that need to be accessed globally in your game.

```swift
extends Node


#region Physics layers
const world_collision_layer: int = 1
const player_collision_layer: int = 2
const enemies_collision_layer: int = 4
const hitboxes_collision_layer: int = 8
#endregion


```

`GlobalGameEvents` contains all the global signals by which any node or script can connect. It contains few basic ones and this is where you should place those events that you want multiple nodes to listen to

## WindowManager

One of the most important and allows you to have control of the game windows as well as resolution information, take screenshots and much more.

**By default**, it's connected to the `size_changed` signal of the `root` node to center the monitor screen automatically when a resolution it's changed.

### Resolutions

There is multiple constants defined in this manager to get the resolutions from a specific aspect-ratio, this are:

```swift
// Use the built-in methods to get resolutions, this methods support a boolean variable to limit the resolutions based on the player current monitor
WindowManager.get_mobile_resolutions()
WindowManager.get_4_3_resolutions()
WindowManager.get_16_9_resolutions()
WindowManager.get_16_10_resolutions()
WindowManager.get_21_9_resolutions()

// List of available resolutions
var resolutions: Dictionary = {
	Resolution_Mobile: [
